# Notes

the base ModLoader provides basic events like access to bedrocks WndProc aswell as an exit event and a load event for when the mod loader has finished loading mods
but the LightUt library still requires signatures to hook raknet and provide other basics

# How to install

drag the LightLoader.zip into your xbox games folder (Mine is C:\XboxGames\Minecraft for Windows\Content\)</br>
unzip it and then put mods in the mods folder
